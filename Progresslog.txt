Nothing has been done during these 2 weeks.


19.3
Refractored some code -> made a seperate class for dialogs to make code more
readable. Started to refractor the whole Events class.
The project is roughly at the phase as planned.
Until the next meeting, goal is to have all the basic and easy functionalities
implemented.

5.4
- Refractored a lot of code. Implemented alarm, made all the easy level functions somewhat work except daily view.
- Added Classes/Objects: Event, Alarm, calendarState, DailyviewTab and publicHolidays

- Noticed some problems with the displaying public holidays.
- All the easy level functions have been tested.
- Importing and exporting alarm seems to have some problems -> Google calendar doesnt record any alarms
- Workload about 25h
The project is a little bit behind the phase as planned.
Until the next meeting, goal is to implement all the medium level tasks
