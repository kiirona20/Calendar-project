6.3
Nothing has been done during these 2 weeks.


20.3
Events Class has been added. Implemented data structure. Add, delete and edit functions implemented.
Implemented a way to read and write Calendar data to the eventInfo file.

I found hard to find a way to append, delete and edit data from a file. Specifically
preserving the already exisinting data and only modifying the data that is needed to modify.

Workload was about 15 hours.

The project is approx 2 weeks behind from schedule.
