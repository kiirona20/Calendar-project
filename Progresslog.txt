6.3
Nothing has been done during these 2 weeks.


19.3
Refractored some code -> made a seperate class for dialogs to make code more
readable. Started to refractor the whole Events class.
The project is roughly at the phase as planned.
Until the next meeting, goal is to have all the basic and easy functionalities
implemented.
