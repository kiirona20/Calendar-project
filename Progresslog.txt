6.3
Nothing has been done during these 2 weeks.


20.3
Events Class has been added. Implemented data structure. Add, delete and edit functions implemented.
Implemented a way to read and write Calendar data to the eventInfo file.

I found hard to find a way to append, delete and edit data from a file. Specifically
preserving the already exisinting data and only modifying the data that is needed to modify.

Workload was about 15 hours.

The project is approx 2 weeks behind from schedule.

3.4
Fixed editEvent function. Starting to work on the interface. The project has not been progressing
as intended because I have not been prioritizing this project over other school work. 

I find it hard to start working on the interface since it requires a lot of background research.

Workload was about 1 hour

The project is approx 4 weeks behind from schedule.
