This is my first full-scale course project: an interactive calendar app built entirely using Scala libraries.

The calendar features a visual UI that supports all essential functionalities, including adding, deleting, editing, and dragging events to reschedule them. It also includes useful features such as event alarms/reminders, as well as importing and exporting events from other calendars.
